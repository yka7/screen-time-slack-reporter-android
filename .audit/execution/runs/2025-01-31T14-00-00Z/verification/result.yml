  summary: |
    Significant progress in establishing the quality baseline.
    - Fixed critical build and test environment issues (Gradle 8.13 -> 8.10 downgrade, JaCoCo config).
    - Enabled test coverage measurement.
    - Achieved 18% coverage by testing key ViewModels and Repositories.
    - Verified all core functions are working.
  
  remaining_work:
    - Expand test coverage to remaining UseCases and DataSources.
    - Fix Lint issues.
    - Set up CI/CD.

  next_cycle_focus:
    - "Generate more tests for Domain/Data layers to boost coverage."
